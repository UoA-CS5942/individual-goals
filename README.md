Clone and then fork this repo and then answer the questions below. Afterwards submit a pull request on the original repo so that I can capture your GitHub account name and set up your team repo for the class.

## Over the summer I want to ... 
Become a capable web app designer and a good programmer. 
learn team management and time management skills.

## A big problem with group projects is ...
Being able to collaborate with different people from different timezones, is a major concern. 
Getting to make a conversation among the team members is also a major concern.
different levels of skillsets and different mentalities. 

## The best part of group projects is ...
Work could be shared and improved, having a helping hand when stuck with questions,
or having someone who knows any topic better than us makes it helpful.
